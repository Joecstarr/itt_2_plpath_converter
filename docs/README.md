## Note to Reader

### What Am I?

The _Identity Tangle Tree (ITT) to Piecewise Linear (PL) Path_ is a runnable wrapper for the
[Tanglenomicon Core Libraries](https://github.com/Uiowa-Applied-Topology/tanglenomicon_core_libraries).
Specifically, the ITT runnable takes command line input in the form of an ITT and output a PL path
realizing that ITT in $\R^3$.

### About the Documentation

The following document describes the "rules" and expectation for the ITT to PL Path tool. The
["Code Comments"](./lib/files/) page contains the technical context descriptions found in the source
files. The ["Decisions"](./madr/) page contains a collection of
[architectural decision records](https://adr.github.io/madr/) [@Kopp2018] giving context on why this
is the way it is.

### Issues

If you discover an issue with this repository or have a question, please feel free to open an issue.
I've included templates for the following issues:

- 🖋️ Spelling and Grammar: Found some language that is incorrect?
- 🤷 Clarity: Found a section that just makes no sense?
- ❓ Question: Do you have a general question?
- 🐞 Bug: Found an error in the code?
- 🚀 Enhancement: Have a suggestion for improving the toolchain?

## Planning and Administration

### Tasks

Tasks are tracked as GitHub issues.

### Version Control

The toolchain shall be kept under Git versioning. Development shall take place on branches with
`main` on GitHub as a source of truth. GitHub pull requests shall serve as the arbiter for inclusion
on main with the following quality gates:

- Compiling of source code.
- Running and passing the unit test suite.
- Running and passing linting and style enforcers.
- Successful generation of documentation.

#### Release Tagging

The project shall be tagged when a new feature or bug fix is merged into main. The tag shall follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for labels.

```text
vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

### Project Structure

Files and directories shall be lower case, where capital is not required by a tool, and contain no
`' '`.

### Directories of Interest

- Source: This directory contains the source and test code for the tool.
- Docs: This directory contains the high level documentation for the tool.

### Define a Unit

A unit in this project shall be defined as a header file.

### Quality

The tool and its units shall fail-safe, that is the tool and its units can fail, but the failure
must be detectable. A segfault is okay, an off by one error that computes the wrong value is not.

#### Unit Testing

No unit testing is expected.

#### Integration Testing

Integration tests are expected to be carried out for the tool. Test specifications can be found in
the [test directory](./test/).

#### Requirements

##### Architectural Decisions

Architectural decisions [MADR](<https://github.com/adr/madr>) [@Kopp2018] serve as the primary
documentation for the architecture of the tool.

##### Program Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "Parse arguments" as pi 
    state "Read from standard in" as rstdin 
    state "Write to standard out" as wstdout 
    state "Deterimine WPTT buffer size" as dwb
    state "Parse input as WPTT" as pw 
    state "Compute PL buffer size" as cplbs 
    state "Compute PL path" as cpp 
    state "Determine string buffer size" as dsbs 
    state "Encode PL path as string" as epp 
    [*] --> pi
    pi --> rstdin
    rstdin --> dwb
    dwb --> pw
    pw --> cplbs
    cplbs --> cpp
    cpp --> dsbs
    dsbs --> epp
    epp --> wstdout
    wstdout --> [*]

```

#### Nonfunctional Requirements

##### Colors

Diagrams included in documentation for features (use case and unit descriptions) are expected to use
the [COLORS](https://clrs.cc) color palette.

##### Technologies

###### Languages and Frameworks

The tool shall be written in C++ using clang for compiling and CMake as a build system. This
requires all 'external' interfaces to be C++ linkable.

Unit testing of runnable and data wrangler libraries will use the
[Unity](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity) and [CMock](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/cmock)
libraries for unit testing. Test indexing is handled by
[CTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CTest.html).

**Tools**:

- git
- mermaid.js
- Unity
- clang
- CMake
- CTest
- Doxygen
- CMock
- Python
- mkdocs
- Pytest
- prek
- valgrind
- tombi
- uncrustify
- rumdl
- MADR[@Kopp2018]

###### Documentation of Implementation

C/C++ code is documented with [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/). Documentation shall be aggregated
using the [mkdoxy](https://mkdoxy.kubaandrysek.cz/) framework.

###### Code Style Guide

The C/C++ code in this repository shall be formatted by the bundled uncrustify configuration.
